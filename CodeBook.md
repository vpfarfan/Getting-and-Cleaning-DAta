# Code Book

The run_analysis.R script performs the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.  This is done by using cbind() and rbind() functions.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.  Using the features.txt file, only the means and standard deviation columns are selected.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.  The activity number is replaced by the label, taken from the file activity_labels.txt.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.  Columns without names are corrected.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.  Using the function aggregate, the means are calculated for each measure, for each activity and subject.  The tidy dataset is writen into the text file tidy.txt.
